# Flow Document: Contributor Portal
### Gaps & Risks Identified

#### 1. "AGI" terminology
Inaccurately refers to the technology as "Artificial General Intelligence" when it should be referred to as "Multi-AI" or "AI-driven"

#### 2. Missing lifecycle stages
Sorting/Assortment and Polishing are missing as distinct lifecycle stages from Cutting

#### 3. Cold-start data problem
No data acquisition strategy defined

#### 4. Missing personas
End consumers and Insurance companies are missing personas

#### 5. No phasing/prioritization
All 25 sections presented as equal priority; need MVP definition

#### 6. No NFRs
No non-functional requirements (performance, scalability, availability, security SLAs) defined

#### 7. Hardware integration undefined
Which scanners, spectroscopes, and cutting machines to support?

#### 8. Regulatory complexity
Investment/tokenization modules face securities regulation hurdles

#### 9. Mining module scope risk
Geological/satellite capabilities are an entirely different domain

#### 10. Architecture gaps
Auth, multi-tenancy, API gateway, and encryption not specified

#### 11. No mention of mobile
Diamond traders work heavily on mobile (WhatsApp-based trading is common)

#### 12. No timeline or team sizing
SOW has scope but no schedule or resource estimates

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2026-03-06
**SOW Module:** Contributor Portal (Section 19.2 + 3.1.5 + 20)
**Target Users:** All contributor types -- students, women workforce, freelancers, internal employees (Section 2.3)
**Basis:** Every flow in this document is derived from SOW V1.1. Section numbers are cited inline. Nothing is invented.

**Important:** Students and Women Workforce are TRACKS within the single Contributor Portal (Section 20), NOT separate portals. Flows marked [Student Track] or [Women Track] indicate segment-specific variations within the shared portal.

## A. REGISTRATION & ONBOARDING

---

### A1: External Contributor Registration (via invite link)

**SOW References:** Section 3.1.MVP.3 (contributor registration -- external via invite), Section 3.1.5 (registration, identity verification, onboarding workflows)

**Entry Point:** Contributor clicks invite link received via email (sent by enterprise admin -- Flow H5 in Enterprise Console doc).

**Pre-conditions:**
- Enterprise admin has sent an invite to the contributor's email (Section 3.1.MVP.3 -- external via invite).
- Contributor has a device with internet access.

**Step-by-step Flow:**

| Step | Screen/State | Data Displayed | Actions Available |
|------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Invite Landing Page** | Platform branding. Welcome message: "You've been invited to join GlimmoraTeam." Invite context: who invited, for what purpose (if provided). Language selector (Section 3.1.5 -- localization framework). | Select language; click "Create Account". |
| 2 | **Registration Form** | Fields: email (pre-filled from invite), full name, password (or SSO option if enterprise IdP configured), phone number (optional), country/region. Terms of use and privacy policy links (Section 14.3 -- terms of use). | Fill fields; read terms; submit. |
| 3 | **Email Verification** | "We've sent a verification code to [email]. Enter the code below." Input field for verification code. Resend option with cooldown timer. | Enter code; resend; change email. |
| 4 | **Account Created** | Success message: "Account created. Let's set up your profile." | Proceed to profile setup (Flow A5). |

**Decision Points:**
- Step 2: SSO available for this invite? YES -> "Sign in with your organization" option. NO -> email/password registration.
- Step 3: Code valid? YES -> Step 4. NO -> "Invalid code. Please try again."

**Error/Edge Cases:**
- Invite link expired: "This invite has expired. Please contact [inviter] for a new invite."
- Email already registered: "This email is already registered. Sign in instead?" with login link.
- Weak password: inline validation with requirements display.
- Network interruption during registration: form state preserved; retry on reconnect.

**Exit Points:**
- Account created -> Flow A5 (Profile Setup).
- Abandoned registration -> can resume via invite link.

**Audit:** Registration event logged: user ID (new), timestamp, invite source, registration method.

---

### A2: Internal Contributor Registration (via HRIS sync)

**SOW References:** Section 3.1.MVP.3 (contributor registration -- internal via HRIS sync OR manual import), Section 3.1.MVP.9 (HRIS import/sync)

**Entry Point:** Internal employee's account is auto-created via HRIS sync. Employee receives notification (email/internal system) that their GlimmoraTeam account is ready.

**Pre-conditions:**
- Enterprise admin has configured HRIS integration (Enterprise Console Flow H4).
- HRIS sync has run and created the employee's contributor record.
- Employee has SSO credentials via enterprise IdP.

**Step-by-step Flow:**

| Step | Screen/State | Data Displayed | Actions Available |
|------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Notification** | Email or internal notification: "Your GlimmoraTeam contributor account has been created. Sign in to complete your profile." Link to Contributor Portal. | Click link. |
| 2 | **SSO Login** | Standard SSO login (SAML/OIDC). Enterprise IdP authentication. | Enter enterprise credentials; authenticate. |
| 3 | **Welcome / First Login** | "Welcome to GlimmoraTeam, [Name]." Pre-populated fields from HRIS: name, email, role, department, cost center. "Please review and complete your profile." | Review pre-populated data; proceed to profile setup. |
| 4 | **Profile Completion** | Redirected to consent capture (Flow A4) and then profile setup (Flow A5) to add skills and preferences not available from HRIS. | Complete profile setup flow. |

**Decision Points:**
- Step 3: HRIS data correct? YES -> proceed. NO -> flag discrepancy for admin review (contributor cannot edit HRIS-sourced fields directly).

**Error/Edge Cases:**
- HRIS sync error (employee not found): "Your account could not be created. Contact your HR administrator."
- Partial HRIS data: some fields pre-populated, others blank for manual entry.
- Employee already has external contributor account: account linking flow (merge profiles) or admin resolution.

**Exit Points:**
- Profile completion -> Flow A4 (Consent) then Flow A5 (Skills Setup).

**Audit:** Account creation logged: user ID, timestamp, source = "HRIS_sync", HRIS record ID.

---

### A3: Identity Verification Flow

**SOW References:** Section 3.1.5 (identity verification), Section 3.1.MVP.3 (contributor registration -- identity verification)

**Entry Point:** After registration (Flow A1 or A2), as part of onboarding sequence.

**Pre-conditions:**

- Identity verification required by platform policy.

**Step-by-step Flow:**

| Step | Screen/State | Data Displayed | Actions Available |
|------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Verification Prompt** | "To ensure platform safety, we need to verify your identity." Explanation of why verification is needed and what data is collected. Privacy assurance: "Your documents are used for verification only and stored securely (Section 15 -- encryption at rest)." | Proceed; skip for now (if policy allows). |
| 2 | **Verification Method** | Options based on platform configuration: Government ID upload (photo of ID document), Email verification (already completed in A1), Phone verification (SMS code), Institutional verification (for student track -- university email/ID). | Select method; proceed. |
| 3a | **ID Upload** | Camera capture or file upload for ID document. Guidelines: "Ensure document is clearly visible, all corners in frame." | Take photo / upload file; retake. |
| 3b | **Phone Verification** | Enter phone number; receive SMS code; enter code. | Send code; enter code; resend. |
| 3c | **Institutional Verification** | Enter university email or student ID. Verification link/code sent to institutional email. | Enter email/ID; verify code. |
| 4 | **Processing** | "Verifying your identity..." Processing indicator. Timeframe: "This may take a few minutes to a few hours." | Wait; continue with limited access. |
| 5a | **Verified** | "Identity verified!" Green checkmark. Full platform access granted. | Continue to profile setup or dashboard. |
| 5b | **Verification Failed** | "We couldn't verify your identity. Please try again or contact support." Reason (if safe to disclose). | Retry; contact support; upload different document. |

**Decision Points:**
- Step 2: Which verification method? Depends on contributor type and platform policy.
- Step 4: Verification successful? YES -> 5a. NO -> 5b.

**Error/Edge Cases:**
- Blurry ID photo: "Image quality too low. Please retake with better lighting."
- SMS not received: resend option; alternative method fallback.
- Verification service timeout: "Verification taking longer than expected. We'll notify you when complete."
- Skip allowed: contributor can use platform with limited access (e.g., can browse but not accept tasks) until verified.

**Exit Points:**
- Verified -> continue onboarding.
- Failed -> retry or support.

**Audit:** Verification attempt logged: user ID, timestamp, method, result, verification provider (if external).

---

| 4 | **Skills Summary** | List of all declared skills with proficiency levels. Minimum skills required: system indicates if minimum met (e.g., "Add at least 1 skill to continue"). | Add more; edit; remove; proceed to evidence (Flow A6). |
| 5 | **Save** | Skills saved to contributor profile. Digital twin v1 initialized (Section 3.1.MVP.3 -- skills list). | Continue onboarding; skip evidence for now. |

**Decision Points:**
- Step 4: Minimum skills declared? YES -> can proceed. NO -> prompted to add more.

**Error/Edge Cases:**
- Skill not in taxonomy: "Can't find your skill? Request to add it." Free-text entry flagged for taxonomy review.
- Too many skills selected (potential gaming): system may limit or flag excessive declarations.
- Returning to edit skills later: same flow, existing skills pre-loaded.

**Exit Points:**
- Skills saved -> Flow A6 (Evidence) or Flow A7 (Availability) or Dashboard.

**Audit:** Skills declaration logged: user ID, timestamp, skills added/removed, proficiency levels.

---

### A6: Profile Setup -- Evidence Attachments (links/docs)

| 2 | **Evidence Upload** | For selected skill: two options -- "Upload Document" (PDF, DOC, images -- certificates, portfolios) and "Add Link" (GitHub, portfolio URL, LinkedIn project). | Upload file; paste URL; add description. |
| 3 | **Evidence Detail** | For each evidence item: title/description field, associated skill(s), upload date. Preview for uploaded documents (if supported). | Edit description; remove; add more. |
| 4 | **Evidence Summary** | All evidence items listed by skill. "X skills with evidence, Y skills without evidence." | Add more evidence; proceed; skip for now. |

**Decision Points:**
- Evidence is optional but recommended. System may display: "Profiles with evidence get matched X% more often" (if platform tracks this -- derived from Section 3.1.MVP.4 matching quality signals).

**Error/Edge Cases:**
- File too large: "File exceeds maximum size of [X]MB. Please compress or upload a smaller file."
- Invalid URL: "This URL doesn't appear to be valid. Please check and retry."
- Privacy concern: message "Evidence is only visible to authorized platform reviewers and is not publicly displayed" (reinforces privacy -- Section 20.3).

**Exit Points:**
- Evidence saved -> Flow A7 (Availability) or Dashboard.

| 4 | **Availability Saved** | Confirmation. Matching engine will use this to recommend appropriate tasks. | Continue onboarding; adjust later. |

**Decision Points:**
- Step 2: Detailed schedule or simple hours entry? User chooses.

**Error/Edge Cases:**
- Zero availability: warning "With zero available hours, you won't be matched to tasks."
- Very limited availability (e.g., 5 hrs/week): system notes this for matching; only short/small tasks recommended.
- Timezone change: affects SLA calculations for assigned tasks.

**Exit Points:**

| 1 | **Task Discovery Page** | List/card view of available tasks matched to contributor's skills. Each task card shows: task name, project name (anonymized if confidential), required skills (chips), estimated effort (hours), task pricing (rate for this task), due date, match score ("Great match" / "Good match"). Sorted by match relevance. | Browse; filter; sort; search; click for detail. |
| 2 | **Filters** | Filter by: skill category, effort range (hours), due date range, project type, task status (open for assignment). | Apply/clear filters. |
| 3 | **Sort** | Sort by: match score (default), due date, effort, price. | Select sort option. |
| 4 | **Task Card Click** | Navigate to Task Detail View (Flow D2). | View full task detail. |

**Decision Points:**
- Step 1: Tasks displayed are pre-filtered by matching engine (Section 3.1.MVP.4) based on contributor's skills + availability + quality signals.

**Error/Edge Cases:**
- No matching tasks: "No tasks match your current skills and availability. Try updating your skills profile or check back later."
- Very many tasks: pagination; "Recommended for you" section at top with best matches.
- Confidential projects: task visible but project name anonymized; details revealed after assignment.

**Exit Points:**
- Click task -> Flow D2 (Task Detail).
- Return to Dashboard.

**Audit:** Task discovery access logged: user ID, timestamp, tasks displayed count, filters applied.

---

Acceptance criteria summary. | Read detail; accept assignment (Flow D3); decline (Flow D4); back to browse. |
| 2 | **Requirements Section** | Detailed task instructions (if visible before assignment -- may be partial until accepted). Required deliverables list. Evidence checklist preview. Templates available (if any). | Read requirements. |
| 3 | **Match Explanation** | Why this task was recommended to the contributor. Skills overlap shown. | Review match reasoning. |

**Decision Points:**
- Contributor decides: accept or decline this task assignment?

**Error/Edge Cases:**
- Task assigned to someone else while contributor is viewing: "This task is no longer available."
- Task requires skills contributor doesn't have: match indicator shows "partial match" with note "You may need [skill] for this task."
- Confidential task: limited detail until assignment accepted.

**Exit Points:**
- Accept -> Flow D3.
- Decline -> Flow D4.
- Back to browse -> Flow D1.

**Audit:** Task detail view logged: user ID, timestamp, task ID.

---

### D3: Accept Assignment Flow

**SOW References:** Section 3.1.MVP.4 (assignment workflow -- accept/decline)

**Entry Point:** Task Detail > "Accept Assignment" button.

**Pre-conditions:**
- Task available for assignment to this contributor.
- Contributor has capacity (availability allows).

**Step-by-step Flow:**

| Step | Screen/State | Data Displayed | Actions Available |
|------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Acceptance Confirmation** | "Accept this task?" Summary: task name, estimated effort, earnings upon acceptance, due date, SLA requirements. "By accepting, you commit to delivering by the due date." | Confirm accept; cancel. |

- Task assignment pending contributor response.

**Step-by-step Flow:**

| Step | Screen/State | Data Displayed | Actions Available |
|------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Decline Reason** | "Why are you declining this task?" Reason options: "Not enough time", "Skills don't match", "Task description unclear", "Personal reasons", "Other" (free text). Reason is optional but encouraged. | Select reason; add comment; confirm decline. |
| 2 | **Decline Confirmed** | "Task declined." Task removed from contributor's pending list. Matching engine will recommend the task to next best candidate. | Return to task browse; view other tasks. |

**Decision Points:**
- Step 1: Reason provided? Optional but system may use for matching improvement.

**Error/Edge Cases:**
- Frequently declining tasks: system does not penalize but may adjust matching (fewer recommendations for this skill/type if consistently declined).
- Decline after SLA expiry: treated as SLA breach, not a decline.

**Exit Points:**
- Declined -> Task Discovery (Flow D1).

**Audit:** Decline logged: user ID, task ID, timestamp, reason (if provided).

---

### D5: SLA Timer Display & Notifications

**SOW References:** Section 3.1.MVP.4 (SLA timers)

| 2 | **SLA Notifications** | Automatic notifications at configurable thresholds: 50% time elapsed, 75% time elapsed, 24 hours remaining, SLA breached. Notification channels: in-app, email, SMS (per contributor preferences -- Flow K2). | View notification; navigate to task. |
| 3 | **SLA Breach** | If due date passes without submission: status changes to "SLA Breached". Alert on Dashboard. Enterprise admin notified. | Submit ASAP; contact support; request extension (if supported by policy -- Section 4.3). |

**Decision Points:**
- Notifications automatic based on configured thresholds.

**Error/Edge Cases:**
- SLA extension requested: if configured escalation rules allow (Section 4.3), contributor may request extension through support.
- Multiple tasks with overlapping SLAs: prioritized display with most urgent first.
- Timezone-related SLA confusion: all SLAs shown in contributor's local timezone.

**Exit Points:**
- Navigate to task Workroom from any SLA notification.

**Audit:** SLA events logged: task ID, threshold reached, notification sent, breach (if applicable), timestamp.

| 2 | **Task Detail -- Student View** | Same as Flow D2 plus: Guardrails section showing -- "This task is reviewed by a mentor before client acceptance" (supervision model), Complexity level (beginner/intermediate), Learning objectives (what skills this task develops), Academic recognition eligibility (if applicable -- Section 20.1). | Accept; decline; view learning objectives. |
| 3 | **Supervision Indicator** | After acceptance: workroom shows "Mentor supervision active" badge. Student knows their work will be reviewed by a mentor before reaching the client (two-stage review per Section 3.1.MVP.5). | View mentor info; access Q&A. |

**Decision Points:**
- Tasks automatically filtered for student track; student can also browse general tasks if skills match.

**Error/Edge Cases:**
- Student qualifies for advanced tasks: system allows access with note "This task is beyond typical student level. Mentor supervision will be applied."
- No student-appropriate tasks: "No student tasks available right now. Check back soon or update your skills to broaden matches."

**Exit Points:**
- Accept task -> Workroom with supervision active.
- Browse general tasks (if permitted by university partnership terms).

**Audit:** Student task discovery logged: user ID, timestamp, student flag, tasks shown, guardrails applied.

| 2b | **Assigned New Task** | New task appears in active tasks. Standard accept/decline workflow (Flows D3/D4) if assignment requires acceptance. If admin override: auto-assigned. | Accept/decline (if applicable); go to Workroom. |

**Decision Points:**
- Step 2b: Does new assignment require acceptance? Depends on configuration (admin override may auto-assign).

**Error/Edge Cases:**
- Reassignment while contributor is mid-submission: work preserved; contributor notified before removal.
- Multiple reassignments: each logged and notified separately.

**Exit Points:**
- Acknowledge -> Dashboard or new task Workroom.

**Audit:** Reassignment notification logged: user ID, task ID, direction (from/to), reason, timestamp.

**Error/Edge Cases:**
- Unclear rework feedback: use Q&A to ask for clarification.
- Rework deadline too tight: request extension via support (if policy allows -- Section 4.3).
- Contributor disagrees with rework decision: grievance redressal (Flow J2).

**Exit Points:**
- Begin rework -> Workroom (Flow E1-E6 cycle).

**Decision Points:**
- Step 3: Confirm? YES -> submitted. NO -> continue editing.

**Error/Edge Cases:**
- Rework submission identical to original: system doesn't prevent but reviewer will notice.
- Maximum rework cycles reached: system may flag for escalation per governance policy.

**Exit Points:**
- Submitted -> Flow F1 (status tracking).

- Mentor rejects: does not proceed to client stage.

**Error/Edge Cases:**
- Long review at either stage: SLA tracking shows which stage is pending.
- Conflicting feedback between stages: contributor receives feedback from both for comprehensive guidance.

**Exit Points:**
- Accepted -> Flow F5 then Flow G1.
- Rework -> Flow F3.

### K3: Language / Locale Selection

**SOW References:** Section 3.1.5 (localization framework for multiple languages)

**Entry Point:** Settings > Language, OR initial landing page language selector (Flow A1).

**Pre-conditions:**
- Contributor authenticated (or on landing page before login).

**Step-by-step Flow:**

| Step | Screen/State | Data Displayed | Actions Available |
|------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Language Selection** | Available languages (platform-supported per localization framework): English, Urdu, Arabic, Hindi, others as configured. Current selection highlighted. Preview text in selected language. RTL layout indicator for Arabic/Urdu. | Select language; preview; save. |
| 2 | **Locale Settings** | Date format (DD/MM/YYYY vs MM/DD/YYYY), number format (1,000.00 vs 1.000,00), currency display preference. | Set locale preferences; save. |
| 3 | **Apply** | Interface immediately switches to selected language. All UI elements, labels, and system messages translated. User-generated content (task descriptions, reviews) remains in original language. | Confirm; revert if needed. |

**Decision Points:**
- Language selection affects all UI elements.

**Error/Edge Cases:**
- Incomplete translation: untranslated strings shown in English with note "Translation in progress."
- RTL layout: interface mirrors for Arabic/Urdu (Section 3.1.5 -- localization framework).
- Language change mid-task: workroom content (instructions, templates) stays in original language; only UI chrome changes.

**Exit Points:**
- Language applied -> all portal pages now in selected language.

**Audit:** Language/locale change logged: user ID, timestamp, previous language, new language.
