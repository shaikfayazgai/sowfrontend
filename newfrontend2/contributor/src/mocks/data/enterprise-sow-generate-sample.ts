  projectVision:
    "Build a unified enterprise resource planning platform that consolidates procurement, inventory management, and financial reporting into a single cloud-native application, replacing three legacy systems and reducing operational overhead by 40%.",
  businessObjectives: [
    "Reduce manual data entry by 60% through automated workflows within 6 months of launch",
    "Achieve 99.9% system uptime for mission-critical procurement operations",
    "Enable real-time financial reporting with less than 5-second dashboard load times",
    "Decrease procurement cycle time from 14 days to 3 days",
  ],
  painPoints: [
    "Three disconnected legacy systems require manual data reconciliation daily, consuming 4+ FTE hours",
    "No real-time visibility into inventory levels across 12 warehouse locations",
    "Financial close process takes 15 business days due to manual consolidation",
    "Vendor onboarding requires 23 manual steps across multiple systems",
  ],
  strategicContext: "digital_transformation",
  businessCriticality: "mission_critical",
  currentState:
    "The organization currently operates on SAP R/3 (2008 version), a custom-built inventory tracker in MS Access, and QuickBooks Enterprise for financial reporting. Data is synchronized via nightly CSV exports.",
  currentStateType: "existing",
  desiredFutureState:
    "A single cloud-native ERP platform with real-time data synchronization, role-based dashboards, automated approval workflows, and mobile access for warehouse managers. Full API integration with existing CRM (Salesforce) and HR (Workday) systems.",
  previousAttempts:
    "A 2023 attempt to migrate to SAP S/4HANA was abandoned after 8 months due to scope creep and budget overruns. Key lesson: phased rollout is essential.",
  endUserProfiles: [
    "Procurement managers (25 users) — create POs, manage vendor relationships, approve purchases",
    "Warehouse staff (60 users) — scan barcodes, update inventory, process receiving",
    "Finance team (15 users) — generate reports, manage GL entries, perform reconciliation",
    "Executive leadership (8 users) — view dashboards, approve budgets, monitor KPIs",
    "External vendors (200+) — submit invoices, update catalogs, view PO status",
  ],
  languageRequirements: ["English (primary)", "Spanish (warehouse staff)", "French (Canadian operations)"],
  userExpectations: [
    "Sub-3-second page load times for all core workflows",
    "Mobile-responsive interface for warehouse barcode scanning",
    "Single sign-on integration with existing Azure AD",
    "Offline capability for warehouse operations during network outages",
  ],
  successMetrics: [
    "40% reduction in operational overhead within 12 months",
    "95% user adoption rate within 3 months of go-live",
    "Zero critical defects in production for first 90 days",
    "ROI break-even within 18 months",
  ],
  enterpriseExpectations:
    "The platform must comply with SOX requirements for financial controls and provide complete audit trails for all procurement transactions.",
  definitionOfSuccess:
    "The project is considered successful when all three legacy systems are fully decommissioned, 95% of users are actively using the new platform daily, and the finance team can close monthly books within 5 business days.",
